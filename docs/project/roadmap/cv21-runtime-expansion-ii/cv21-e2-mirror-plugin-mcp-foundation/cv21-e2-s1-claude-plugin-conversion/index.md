# CV21.E2.S1 — Claude plugin conversion

**Status:** 🟡 Planned
**Type:** Implementation
**User-visible outcome:** Mirror Mind's standalone `.claude/` integration (skills + lifecycle hooks) is repackaged as a canonical Claude-format plugin that `claude plugin validate` accepts and Claude loads, while the existing standalone `.claude/` path keeps working unchanged.

---

## Scope

- Create the canonical plugin directory with a `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
  manifest that validates on `claude` 2.1.114 (no unsupported keys such as
  `$schema`).
- Bundle the full canonical `mm-*` skill set into the plugin's `skills/`,
  reconciling the current `.claude/skills/` drift (`discard`, `explore`, `soul`,
  `update` are missing today).
- Bundle the four lifecycle hooks into the plugin and make their paths
  plugin-relative (`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`), preserving today's behavior:
  `SessionStart` logging, `UserPromptSubmit` Mirror inject + user-prompt log,
  `Stop` session-end + backup.
- Pass `claude plugin validate <plugin-path>`.
- Prove plugin load + skill discovery + a hook firing with an isolated smoke
  test that mutates no production mirror, repo, or runtime config.

---

## Non-goals

- No MCP server (that is S2).
- No `statusLine` wiring (that is S3).
- No removal of the standalone `.claude/` integration; both coexist this epic.
- No marketplace publishing.
- No change to `memory` core behavior — this story is packaging only.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- `claude plugin validate <plugin-path>` passes.
- The plugin manifest version matches `pyproject.toml`.
- The plugin's `skills/` contains the full canonical `mm-*` set (25 skills), with
  no drift against `.pi/skills/`.
- The plugin's hooks reproduce the four standalone behaviors and resolve paths
  relative to the plugin root, not the repo cwd.
- An isolated smoke test loads the plugin against a temporary database, observes
  a skill as discoverable and a hook firing, and leaves the production DB
  checksum unchanged.
- The standalone `.claude/` integration still works (untouched).
