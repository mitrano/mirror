## E2E

Decision: not_required

Evidence: none

## Navigator Validation

Route: Inspect flow-unit default, set delivery_story, and reset story_by_story with memory build set-flow-unit.

Navigator accepted: no

Expected observation: Builder renders story_by_story and delivery_story choices, records the selected unit, preserves child story traceability wording, and executes no implementation/push/release work from the surface.

Pass condition: Default is story_by_story; delivery_story can be selected and inspected; no non-Ariad behavior changes.

Fail condition: Builder silently switches defaults, hides child stories, or treats flow-unit choice as implementation authorization.

## Missing Evidence

- Navigator validation has not been accepted
