# CV20.DS5 — Debt Ledger And Refactor Loop

**Status:** 🟢 Active

---

## Outcome

Review creates a durable technical-debt ledger and routes pay-now debt through an explicit Refactor loop.

Debt deferred by the Navigator records a reason and revisit trigger. Debt paid now returns to Validation and Review before Done.
