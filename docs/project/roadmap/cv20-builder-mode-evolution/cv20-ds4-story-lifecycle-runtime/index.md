# CV20.DS4 — Story Lifecycle Runtime

**Status:** 🟢 Active

---

## Outcome

Builder can guide Ariad delivery work through Pull, Prepare, Expand/Plan, Approval, Implement, Validation, Review, Coherence, and Done using deterministic lifecycle gates and explicit cadence policy.

---

## Planning Done Target

Before DS4 continues into implementation/validation stages, Builder must reach a methodologically consistent Plan Done state:

- Ariad knows which work item levels are implementable by default.
- Delivery Stories always expand into implementable User/Technical Stories before Plan.
- Runtime cadence distinguishes stepwise testing from normal checkpoint flow.
- Plan materializes a complete story package, not only `plan.md`.
- Plan approval and implementation guard are deterministic runtime transitions.

## Done Condition

DS4 is done when a non-trivial story can move through the Ariad lifecycle without the Driver silently skipping checkpoints, treating non-implementable work as implementable, or declaring progress without required artifacts and evidence.
