# CV18.DS1 — Wisdom Voice

**Status:** 🟢 Implemented · awaiting Pi validation

**Placement:** First new voice in `v0.25.0 — Soul Mode More Voices`

**User-visible outcome:** A user can ask to hear Wisdom Voice during Soul Mode and receive a coherent ritual listening card.

---

## Why This Exists

The first Soul Mode release names a larger constellation than it can yet render. Wisdom is one of the voices the user can intuitively expect to hear, but it is not yet active.

Wisdom Voice is not a generic advisor. It listens for the discernment already present in the experience: the pattern, the lesson, the old repetition, the simple truth, or the maturity trying to emerge.

---

## Scope

- Add Wisdom Voice as an active Soul Mode listening lens.
- Include Wisdom Voice in Possible Listenings when living matter is sufficient.
- Render Wisdom Voice with the same ritual grammar as Self and Shadow.
- Add the prompt and command/service behavior needed for the user to hear the voice.
- Preserve the rule that voice content appears inside the card under `the voice says`.
- Keep Mirror's bridge outside the voice card.
- Ensure Wisdom Voice does not mutate identity, journal, journey state, or project files.

---

## Non-goals

- No Wisdom fragment library.
- No Passagem curation.
- No advice engine.
- No closing integration rite.
- No psyche-layer enrichment.
- No identity mutation.
- No rich UI.

---

## Acceptance Behavior

Given Soul Mode has enough living matter, Possible Listenings includes Wisdom Voice as an available listening.

Given the user asks to hear Wisdom Voice, Mirror renders a Wisdom Voice listening card with what the voice says and what it is listening for.

Given Wisdom Voice responds, it reveals discernment, pattern, lesson, maturity, or simple truth already present in the material rather than prescribing next steps.

Given Wisdom Voice runs, no journal entry, identity entry, or project-state mutation is created automatically.
