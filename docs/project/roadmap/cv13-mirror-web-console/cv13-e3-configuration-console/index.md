# CV13.E3 — Configuration Console

**Status:** ✅ Done
**Release target:** v0.13.0 — Configuration Console
**User-visible outcome:** The local web app can inspect Mirror configuration and, where safe service boundaries exist, adjust selected configuration without exposing secrets or mutating raw files directly.

---

## Scope

This epic turns configuration from hidden local files/environment into guarded local web visibility. It starts read-only and only adds editing where Mirror already has a safe service boundary. Secrets must be masked or excluded.
